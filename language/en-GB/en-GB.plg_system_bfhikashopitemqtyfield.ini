PLG_SYSTEM_BFHIKASHOPITEMQTYFIELD_XML_DESCRIPTION="This plugin handles order item price calculation for items
which have a custom field which affects the price. Typically such custom fields include one of the following.
<ul>
<li>Weight (kg) - using field named 'item_weightkg'.</li>
<li>Length (m) - using field named 'item_lengthm'.</li>
<li>Width (m) - using field named 'item_widthm'.</li>
</ul>
All, and others, of these custom fields can be defined and enabled but,
using product category restrictions, only one can be applicable to a particular product.<br/><br/>
The field names shown are recommendations, but you are free to choose any field name appropriate to your situation."
