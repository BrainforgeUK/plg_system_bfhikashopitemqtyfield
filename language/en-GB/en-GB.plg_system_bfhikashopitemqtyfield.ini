PLG_SYSTEM_BFHIKASHOPITEMQTYFIELD="System - Hikashop Item Custom Field Quantity Handler Plugin by BrainforgeUK"
PLG_SYSTEM_BFHIKASHOPITEMQTYFIELD_XML_DESCRIPTION="This plugin handles order item price calculation for items
which have a custom field which affects the price. Typically such custom fields include one of the following.
<ul>
<li>Weight (kg) - using field named 'item_weightkg'.</li>
<li>Length (m) - using field named 'item_lengthm'.</li>
<li>Width (m) - using field named 'item_widthm'.</li>
</ul>
All, and others, of these custom fields can be defined and enabled but,
using product category restrictions, only one can be applicable to a particular product.<br/><br/>
The field names shown are recommendations, but you are free to choose any field name appropriate to your situation.
<br/><br/>
The custom fields referred to above are often assigned the 'BrainforgeUK - Number' custom field type.
This custom field type is implemented using the plugin <b>plg_hikashop_bfcustomfieldnumber</b>, available from
<a href='https://www.brainforge.co.uk'>https://www.brainforge.co.uk</a>. This number custom field type restricts the
user so that they can only enter numeric values into the assigned field."
