This plugin handles order item price calculation for items which have a custom field which affects the price.

For instance you might have a _Hikashop Custom Item_ field called **product_weight**
which the user can enter when adding the item to an order.
This would allow them to order, say, 2.6Kg of tomatoes etc..
The product unit price might be £1.00, so the item order price will be calculated to be £2.60.

Often used in conjunction with **plg_hikashop_bfcustomfieldnumber**<br/>
